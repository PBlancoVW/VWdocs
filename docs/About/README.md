## What it is

This is the place to share your knowledge with your colleagues. Easily write those things that you know and that you think that could be useful for others in the future.

It uses markdown syntax, so it's easy to write and apply format. This is converted to fancy html on the fly. It also includes a search box. 

See the [Quick start](/About/QuickStart.md) guide to know how to start collaborating.
