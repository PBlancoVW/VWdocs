# VectorDocu

This is the repository for VectorDocu files (they can be found inside the Docs folder).

The .bat file is a script that can be used in Windows to run the website locally (just double click it). You might need to install docsify running `npm i docsify-cli -g` (also for this you might need to install npn running `npm install`).
